# Backend Web Develop Project On A Travel Agency

Developed a backend API and database integration functions using Node.js, Express, and JavaScript. 
This allowed me to effectively fetch data from a MongoDB database and deliver a seamless user experience (UX) on the front end. 
Additionally, I integrated various add-on APIs, such as a CMS system, to enhance the website's functionality and user interface (UI).
